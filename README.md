The stopwatch has the following buttons:
* "Start / Stop" - starts / stops the timer, "Stop" button stops and resets the timer value.

* "Wait" - works on a double click (the time between clicks should not be more than 300 ms). "Wait" pauses the timer; "Start" button resumes the timer.

* "Reset" - resets the stopwatch to "00:00:00" and starts the timer again.
